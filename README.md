# OCR
OCR with caffe deep learning framework
Trains a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network to perform optical character recognition (OCR).

The training set is automatically generated using a heavily modified version of the captcha-generator node-captcha. Support for the MNIST handwritten digit database has been added recently (see performance section).
